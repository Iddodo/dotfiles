** Disable "workspaces-auto-swoosh"
A very annoying behavior where closing/opening a new window
for a specific application, causes macOS to switch workspaces.
Fortunately, this can be easily disabled:

#+begin_src sh :tangle yes
defaults write com.apple.dock workspaces-auto-swoosh -bool NO
#+end_src


For an immediate effect, you can do:
#+begin_src sh :tangle no
killall Dock
#+end_src
