* Info
This repository contains my personal macOS dotfiles for programs including
Kitty, Doom Emacs,  tmux,  zsh,  skhd and yabai.

My intention is mainly to use this repo as a backup and a knowledge system of sorts with regards to my configuration.

These files were designed for use on my system, which is a 2020 M1 MacBook Air running MacOS Ventura. They may not work for your system.


* macOS
You can find my macOS configuration [[file:macOS-configuration/macOS.org][here.]]

* Emacs
** Emacs Fork
The Emacs fork that I use is a fork called emacs-plus, which was designed for use with MacOS.

I use the following command to install it.
#+begin_src shell
brew install emacs-plus@28 --with-no-titlebar --with-no-frame-refocus --with-native-comp
#+end_src
Breakdown of flags:
- A cleaner experience with =--with-no-titlebar=.
- Prevent annoying macOS frame refocus behavior with =--with-no-frame-refocus=.
- Use =--with-native-comp= for overall better performance.

** Doom Emacs
[[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom Emacs]] is an Emacs distribution, which provides a plethora of useful feature, but is mainly famous for its extensive support for more Vim-like behaviors and keybindings,
which is why I use it.

I am in the process of working on a vanilla configuration, in an attempt to make my
workflow more predictable,
but if you come from a Vim background and would like a soft landing into Emacs, I would definitely recommend you give it a shot.

You can view my current configuration [[file:.doom.d/config.org][here]].

** TODO LaTeX
The comfortability I have achieved using Karthink's [[http://karthinks.com/software/latex-input-for-impatient-scholars/][LaTeX Input for Impatient Scholars]]  is pretty amazing.

It currently somewhat break my config, however, so I'm going to want
to make some fixes to it eventually.


* TODO Installation Instructions

* TODO brew
Since I'm on macOS, I use =brew=.

Brewfile is a WIP.

* TODO neovim
My neovim config is a mess since I barely use it anymore, with apparent breaking,
it generally works pretty well however.

I'll probably want to get it fixed, eventually.
